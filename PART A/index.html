    <h3 style="color: #d54b41f8;">Youth and Truth: Unplug with Sadhguru</h3>
    <img src="/images/youth.jpg" alt="book1 image">
    <p><strong>What happens when millennials meet a mystic?</strong>  An avalanche of queries and an unflinching stream of answers. In this compilation of five talks from Youth and Truth events, Sadhguru fields questions that are quirky, personal, profound and shockingly bold from university students.

    <em>In a camaraderie bridging age, they adventure through a mind-boggling spectrum of subjects like romance and sexuality, loneliness and jealousy, parenting and education, career and business, politics and spirituality, artificial intelligence, racism, drugs, food, Yogic sciences, and god-making.</em> Equally wide-ranging is the mood of the talks - from playfulness and hilarity to moments of gobsmacked speechlessness, dawning clarity and paradigm shifts, all infused with the fizzing energy of youth.
        
    Here is a book not just for youth, but for the youthful in search of truth.

    <p>
    Lifestyle investing specialist Justin Donald points out that when it comes to making investment deals, everything is negotiable. He makes investments to generate enough passive income that it makes working at a job optional. His "lifestyle investing" strategy breaks this down into three logical stages — you start by generating enough passive income to meet your minimum expenses (stage 1), grow that to enough passive income to fund your current lifestyle (stage 2), and then ultimately to have enough passive income to fund the lifestyle of your dreams (stage 3).

    Lifestyle investing is a different way of thinking about making investments. Justin Donald talks a lot about structuring investments so you get immediate cash flow. His ideal investments return his principal within a few years, and then keep generating returns for ever more after that. That makes your investments risk-free and cash flow positive. His favored investment vehicles are to purchase mobile home parks, multi-family housing syndications, hard money loans, and newly legalized hemp and recreational drug companies. He also points out you won't get ahead with standard agreements, but will need to negotiate better terms.

    From the creator of 13 Reasons Why, What If It’s Us is soon to be a feature film!

    Ben has spent his first year of college working on his fantasy manuscript with his writing partner Mario, who is a great Spanish tutor, and an even better kisser. So why can’t he stop thinking about the fact that Arthur’s back in town two years after they called it quits?
        
    Arthur is in New York for a dream internship on Broadway, with a boyfriend back at home that he couldn't be happier with. But when he comes upon Ben cuddled up with a mystery boy, he starts to wonder if his feelings for Ben ever truly went away. 
        
    Even as the boys try to focus on their futures, they can't seem to help running into each other in the present. Is the universe forcing them to question if they’re actually meant to be?
        
    Possibly not. After all, things didn’t work the first time around.
    Possibly yes. After all, the sparks are still flying.
    Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith and raise a glass.        
    Here’s to celebrating old friends!
    Here’s to embracing new beginnings!
    Here’s to believing in second chances!
